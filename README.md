# Overview
We usually see 12-hour format analog clock in our day-to-day life. Ever you thought about 24-hour format analog clock and How it would be?
If you are excited to know, then you can see the virtual 24-hr analog clock which is created using basic HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT. Moreover it is responsive too..!!
This clock is similar to 12-hr format but here you will notice that the minute gaps(i.e 5mins,10mins,...) are doubled i.e from 24-2 will be counted as 5 mins and from 2-4 will be counted as next 5mins and so on. If suppose the time is 13:00 then the hour hand will point to 13 and minute hand will point to 24 to indicate it as 13:00 Hours and for time 04:30 the hour hand will point to 4 and minute hand will point to 12. The zip file contains HTML,CSS,JS code files along with the clock image which is created using Figma tool. 
Hope you will find it useful:)
